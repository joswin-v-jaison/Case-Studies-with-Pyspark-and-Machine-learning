# Case-Studies-with-Pyspark-and-Machine-learning
During my Cognizant internship, I tackled diverse PySpark case studies covering predictive analysis and classification tasks. These studies encompassed predicting crew members for a ship company, customer churn for a marketing agency, university classification, movie recommendation, hacking pattern analysis using K Means clustering, and creating a spam filter. This range of projects highlights my proficiency in employing PySpark for solving real-world problems across various domains.
